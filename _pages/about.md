I am a PhD candidate in the [ARGO Team](https://www.di.ens.fr/argo/)  at INRIA Paris and [École Normale Supérieure (DIENS, PSL University)](https://www.di.ens.fr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Ana Bušić](https://www.di.ens.fr/~busic/). My research focuses on **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) on network structured problems** with an emphasis on energy systems applications. I am particularly interested in theoretical aspects of decentralized MARL in fully cooperative problems. I aim at understanding how one can leverage underlying structures of particular problems to learn joint optimal policies with emerging cooperation behavior. I also work on MARL with delays, a very common problem in real systems such as wind farms.

Industrial Experiences
=====
Prior to the beginning of my PhD, I worked during 2 years as a Data-Scientist in industry. I was involved in various industrial AI projects:
- Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning for topology management recommender system for powergrid in close collaboration with **RTE** (French Transmission System Operator).
- Automatic Speech Recognition and Speaker Diarization for the **Senate** (upper house of the French Parliament). 
- Search engine for information retrieval in large document corpus and Retrieval Augmented Generation for **Cartier**.
- Various small internal R&D projects around Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models and Computer Vision.

Before that, I worked during one year as a production engineer at **Syos**, a startup that creates tailormade 3D printed saxophone mouthpieces.

Open-Source Contributions
=====
As an Open-Source enthusiast, I also contributed to some projects and published open-source packages, datasets and models.

- [COGNAC](https://github.com/yojul/cognac/tree/main/cognac): A collection of benchmark environments with inherent network structure for MARL (Accepted at NeurIPS 2025), and its accompanying [set of experiments](https://github.com/yojul/cognac-benchmark-example).
- [Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Model](https://huggingface.co/Lajavaness/wav2vec2-lg-xlsr-fr-speech-emotion-recognition).
- [Winning Autonomous Agent for Learn To Run A Power Network Challenge 2023](https://github.com/lajavaness/l2rpn-2023-ljn-agent).
- [A Large Curated Dataset of One-shot Drum Sample](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yojul/one-shot-hip-hop-drums), it was released with a basic [classification model](https://huggingface.co/yojul/wav2vec2-base-one-shot-hip-hop-drums-clf).

Music
=====
Besides research, I play the saxophone in several bands and compose music.
